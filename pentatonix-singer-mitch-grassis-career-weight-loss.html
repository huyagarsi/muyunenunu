He gained his fame with the renowned a cappella group <a href=#>Pentatonix</a>.

Mitch Grassi also runs a YouTube channel called&nbsp;<a href=#>SUPERFRUIT</a>, along with fellow Pentatonix member, Scott Hoying.</p><p>The channel has almost 2.5 million subscribers. The Pentatonix crew made it into the spotlight a few years ago, when they were the winners of the ‘<a href=#>The Sing-Off</a>‘ show. After this, the group moved to LA, pursuing a career as recording artists. As there was no major mainstream a cappella group, Pentatonix had a great success and are still recording amazing pieces today. Apart from his success with the group and his YouTube channel, Grassi&nbsp;inspired a lot of people with his impressive weight loss.</p><h2>Mitch’s weight loss</h2><p lang=en dir=ltr>MY FAT JEANS ARE BIG ON ME NOW MOMMY IS LOSING WEIGHT</p><p>— Mitch Grassi (@mitchgrassi) <a href=#>December 6, 2013</a></p><p>Mitch Grassi’s’ Weight loss status update on twitter</p><p>Recently, Mitch Grassi has lost a significant amount of weight.&nbsp;Instead of being happy for him for choosing a healthier lifestyle and losing weight, people began questioning the reasons behind this change. There is even a rumor that Mitch’s ex-boyfriend might have persuaded him into losing weight. Yes, you read that right, Mitch is openly gay. His previous relationship with Travis Wright is rumored to be the cause of his weight loss. Some people believe that Travis was abusive. There are rumors about Travis making Mitch feel bad about himself and his weight. However, the singer clearly stated that his ex-boyfriend had nothing to do with this radical change.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>s/o to weight loss</p><p>— Mitch Grassi (@mitchgrassi) <a href=#>January 9, 2014</a></p><p>Grassi went through a gluten-free diet in order to lose weight. An avid supporter and promoter of self-respect, it makes no sense that he would lose that weight for someone else rather than for himself. When it comes to weight loss advice, Mitch’s tips are a gluten free diet and seeking help from a professional health worker.</p><p>Following his weight loss, there is also a rumor that Grassi might’ve had jaw shaving surgery. Although his jaw does look a bit different now, he has not confirmed this rumor.</p><img aria-describedby=caption-attachment-647 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebliveupdate.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Bret-Baier-weight-loss-before-and-after.jpg alt="Bret Baier weight loss before and after" width=600 height=459 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h2>Bio</h2><p>The Pentatonix singer was born on July 24, 1992, as Mitchel Coby Michael Grassi. He grew up in Arlington, Texas. He was passionate about music ever since he was a child, and he strives to become a professional DJ. Grassi has participated in several talent shows. He graduated from <a href=#>Martin High School</a> in 2011 but did not attend any college.</p><p>Mitch met Kirstin Maldonado and Scott Hoying while they were in high school. They first performed together as ‘The Trio’. Later, they were forming the Pentatonix group. When Hoying found out about ‘The Sing-Off’, he wanted Kirstin and Mitch to join him for auditions. But they also needed a bass and a beatboxer. Hoying met Avriel Kaplan (bass) through a mutual friend.</p><p>Their current beatboxer, Kevin Olusola, was popular on YouTube for his beatboxing. He happily agreed to join the group. They went on and won the show’s third season.</p><p>In 2013, Mitch and Scott created SUPERFRUIT, their vlog channel. One year after, the channel already had more than one million subscribers. Their fans keep dreaming of a relationship between the two. Although they have jokingly posted photos saying that they’re married and such, the singers clearly state that they’re only best friends.</p><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>NEW VIDEO!
