Investigators are working to determine what led to the shooting but indicate a domestic dispute may have preceded the incident.</p><p>A law enforcement veteran of over decades of service experience, Ramirez was appointed as director of the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Miami-Dade Police Department in 2020</a> after working his way up through the ranks. He is widely respected in the South Florida community for his leadership and dedication to public service.</p><p>Friends and colleagues expressed shock over the news, praising Ramirez as a thoughtful and charismatic figure devoted to his officers. He championed several progressive policing initiatives during his tenure, including implicit bias and de-escalation training.</p><p>While the circumstances remain unclear, Ramirez’s self-inflicted injury highlights ongoing concerns about mental health strain among first responders. It also underscores the persisting stigma surrounding mental health issues that can deter people from seeking help.</p><p>Authorities continue to investigate shooting but maintain it appears isolated. The Miami-Dade Police Department said Ramirez and his family will receive their full support. Colleagues encourage anyone struggling to reach out for assistance.</p><p>If you or someone you know is having suicidal thoughts, help is available at the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at&nbsp;1-800-273-8255.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-wp-embed is-provider-oxgaps wp-block-embed-oxgaps"><a href=#>German Singer Patty Ryan Died Aged 62: Cause of Death Explored</a>Patty Ryan Died</figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZminqJyusb%2BNqKmgZ52erq61jKmmpaGTmnqltdGemq2nomKzs7HDnbBmqpGitrOx2Waaq6GknrCiuMuyZKKmmqq%2FprCMoqVmmaClrrOxza1krJ2cm3qqusWloJyslZl6tLTOqKuippdk</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
