Well, fast-forward and the single-cam comedy has been picked up to become a new Disney Channel series!</p><p>“We’re thrilled to be in business with Marsai, Norman, Nicole, Joshua, and Carol in bringing this adventure to our viewers, said Ayo Davis, president of Disney Branded Television in a recent statement. “We know that audiences will fall in love with Paris, her friends and her family as they share in the love, laughter and music in this fun-filled world of roller skating.”</p><p>According to <a href=#>Deadline</a>, below is a synopsis of the upcoming series.</p><p>It centers on Paris Johnson, played by Danielle Jalade (Yes Day), who considers roller skating to be part of her soul – she breathes it in and makes it a lifestyle. She lives for the weekends because that’s when she gets to go to her sanctuary, the neon-lit Saturdays, a seemingly magical wood floor roller-rink where the impossible often manifests. In this wondrous place, Paris can hang with her best friends (the We-B-Girlz skate crew), choreograph exhilarating routines on wheels, banter with her rivals, navigate life with her DJ brother London and work on becoming a Golden – a member of Saturday’s skating elite, chosen by the mystical owner of the rink, The Duchess.</p><p>In addition to Jalade, <a href=#>Saturdays </a>will also star Omar Gooding (Family Time) as Cal Johnson, Golden Brooks (Girlfriends) as Deb Johnson, Jermaine Harris (The Map of Tiny Perfect Things) as London Johnson and Daria Johns (Nappily Ever After) as Simone.</p><p>The project will be executive produced by Martin and writer-executive producer Norman Vance Jr. through Genius Entertainment. Show producers include: Nicole Dow and Joshua and Carol Martin.</p><p>Filming for Saturdays is slated to begin in May 2022. We cannot wait for this one to premiere!</p><p><a href=#>Photo: JaGurlTV</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiak6C8r7jIp5xnm5%2BifHN8kWpmampfZX9wucCrqpqhXaKus8DIp6pmq5GpwrOwwLKqZqCRqHqjscKopJ5lnprEbrDIrKWesV2osrO1xKxm</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
