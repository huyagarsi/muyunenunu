Schumaker is now "expected to explore other options after the season."</p><p>The report clarified that the decision to void the 2025 option on Schumaker's contract was not due to the organization's dissatisfaction with his performance. Sources revealed that the agreement was made "during contract talks this past winter."</p><p>The report added that Schumaker was not happy with the departure of general manager Kim Ng, who parted ways with the Marlins in October after Sherman informed her that a new president of baseball operations would be hired above her. Schumaker reportedly "had a good relationship with Ng" and "expressed his concerns in a conversation with Sherman" before the hiring of Peter Bendix as Miami's head of baseball operations.</p><p>Schumaker is the reigning National League Manager of the Year after leading the Marlins to an 84-78 record and a playoff berth. Miami was eliminated by the Philadelphia Phillies in the Wild Card Round.</p><p>It was noted that Schumaker is highly regarded in league circles and would likely receive consideration for manager positions regardless of whether the Marlins can turn their season around.</p><p>While a source said Miami "would have interest" in retaining Schumaker for next season, a return in 2025 reportedly "is not considered likely in the wake of the change in the front office hierarchy, coupled with the organization's decision not to improve the roster this past offseason."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYWt%2BdoOMpqObZaKqurC%2B0makmqqcnru0edKkoKllo5i1trnApJyrZZWtvaav056bZqyfYrK5vMuoqZ5lnprEbrvPraCopqNis7C%2BjGtna21dqLKiv86n</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
