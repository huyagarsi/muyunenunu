The series has been described as an hour-long anthology of murder mysteries, and it will be the first adaptation of The Phantom of the Opera series, which has remained dormant for a while now. Austin will act as both the series writer and executive producer of the show alongside big names like Robert Greenblatt.</p><p>Greenblatt expressed that his rich history with Winsberg’s <a href=#>Musical show</a> was too great to decline collaborating with him in making the new show. Here is everything we know about the upcoming series.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The Show must Go on Season 1 Release Date: When will it premiere?</h2><p>Unfortunately, we have yet to determine how soon the upcoming show will be available for binging on Peacock, but we know it will not be coming out soon. The series was only announced lately, and the high chance is that the script of the upcoming show is yet to start.</p><p>Filming will most likely begin in the mid of next year, and with this in mind, you may binge on the murder mystery by next year or in 2024. We do not know how many episodes the series will have, but we know it will be available on Peacock.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The Show must Go on Season 1 Plot: What will happen?</h2><p>&nbsp;The upcoming series is a murder mystery show that will leave viewers with more questions than answers. So far, the series pot is yet to b revealed, but the series announcement revealed that the Show would be another version of The Phantom of The Opera Live. Each season of the show will consist of a new series of events of some of the gut-wrenching murders shows in history. We also know that the murder scenarios in the upcoming Show will be fictitious, so you do not need to worry about watching another Dahmer-inspired show.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The Show must Go on Season 1 Cast: Who will be in?</h2><p>The cast that will be featured in the upcoming show is yet to be announced, but since the series was only greenlit three months ago, it might take time. We know that Austin Winsberg will be writing the Peacock <a href=#>crime drama series</a>. Wister is famous for writing shows like Zoey’s Extraordinary Playlist, Zoey’s Extraordinary Christmas, and many others. He will also star as the series executive producer alongside Andrew Lloyd, Weber, Robert Greenblatt, Eric and Ki Tannenbaum, and Richard Shepard (<a href=#>Acapulco</a>). Other casts will be announced before the series filming starts.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The Show must Go on Season 1 Trailer: When can we expect it?</h2><p>&nbsp;The trailer of the dark series is yet to be released, and we do not know how soon the trailer will be available. This show’s announcement came in late September, and we would love to argue that filming is yet to begin. Since the trailer can only exist with filming having started, ill have to wait for almost a year before we are sure the series is coming to the screen.</p><p>Therefore, you should expect to binge on the series before 2023. As you wait for the series to debut, there is a hundred other murder mystery shows on Peacock that you may want to watch. Mysteries, Cod Case Files, American Creed, and Snapped are some of the shows you should look for.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmialajBtbvPqZyrq16YvK5706GcZquYpMRuudSsq2afn2K8r3nSnpisp55iv6a4xJqqnmWUlsGmecKaqq1loKG8tXnPq5ydoZOptrC60marq5mZobKzew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
