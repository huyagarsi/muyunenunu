The New York<i> Times</i> gave P.D. James (no relation!) a nice little review for her <a href=#><i>Death Comes to Pemberly</i></a>, which I assume is about digging up Jane Austen’s arm bones and banging the keyboard of a MacBook Pro.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-041d637856898574bdbe237614161ab8-4-0-0@published data-word-count=68>People are reading the hell out of <i>Fifty Shades of Grey</i> and calling it “mommy porn,” saying it rekindled their marriages and introduced them to a world of erotic possibility. So even though I’m late to the phenomenon, I felt compelled to pick it up. After reading it, there are just a few things I don’t understand. Namely, how it’s possible that <i>anybody</i> is turned on by this.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-041d637856898574bdbe237614161ab8-5-0-0@published data-word-count=100>On websites like FF.net, the original home of <i>Fifty Shades of Grey</i>, anybody who can successfully operate a mouse has long had the option to masturbate to a story where <a href=#>Worf</a> has rough sex with <a href=#>DJ from <i>Roseanne</i></a>. For <i>Fifty Shades</i> to have such crossover success, I figured it was probably better written than most fan fiction, and that the characters had been successfully disguised enough not to merit outrage or lawsuits. I have very limited familiarity with the <i>Twilight </i>franchise, but Bella, Edward, and Jacob are culturally omnipresent enough that I could probably pick them out of a lineup.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-041d637856898574bdbe237614161ab8-6-0-0@published data-word-count=98>Christian Grey, the Edward of our story, is a 27-year-old ginger who likes white wine and using emoticons in e-mails. He refuses to use contractions when he speaks, so in my head, I sort of pictured him sounding like Andy Dick at the medieval restaurant in <i>The Cable Gu</i>y. Our Bella, Anastasia Steele, sounded like <i>Speedracer</i>, mostly because she’s always shouting her catchphrase, “Holy crap!” At 21, she’s never given a blow job, but when she does, instinctively knows to use lots of teeth. That dry, skittering sound you heard is your fallopian tubes curling like party ribbon.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-041d637856898574bdbe237614161ab8-7-0-0@published data-word-count=47><i>Fifty Shades </i>dispenses with the supernatural plotline but also the main erotic draw of the <i>Twilight</i> books: the fact that the characters can’t or won’t have sex. Unencumbered by Mormon sexual ethics, pacing, or a YA classification, E.L. James is free to go straight to the fucking.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-041d637856898574bdbe237614161ab8-8-0-0@published data-word-count=9>Here is why the fucking is not very sexy:</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-041d637856898574bdbe237614161ab8-9-0-0@published data-word-count=97><b>The Prose</b>: I’m sorry. I know, it’s soft porn, and it’s not there to better us. But the advantage of erotic fiction over a DVD of <i>I Can’t Believe I Ate the Whole Team</i> is that books will always at least FEEL more high-minded than movies. Besides, there <i>are</i> ways to write sex well. This is not that. This is like Tom Wolfe–bad sex scenes but punctuated by non-sex scenes that are gut-wrenchingly awful. A passage where we find out what Anastasia Steele looks like via girl-frowning-at-her-appearance-in-a-mirror exposition should be punishment for vehicular manslaughter in some states.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-041d637856898574bdbe237614161ab8-10-0-0@published data-word-count=53><b>The Dialogue: </b>As has been noted, our heroine Anastasia Steele begins most of her sentences with “Holy crap!” People say “shall” a lot and “fetch” things instead of get them. When Christian Grey “rips through” Anastasia’s virginity, she actually says “Argh!” like Jon finding out that <i>Garfield</i> has once again shredded the curtains.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-041d637856898574bdbe237614161ab8-11-0-0@published data-word-count=122><b>The Characters</b>: It’s evident that we’re dealing with thinly veiled Twilight characters here, and man, are those thin veils often hilarious<i>. Fifty Shade’s</i> proxy for Stephenie Meyer’s Jacob is a photography student named (wait for it) Jose. It’s fun, because E.L. James is about as conversant with Latino culture as she is with BDSM. Jose likes to grope women when he’s loaded on margaritas and begins every sentence with “Dios mio!” I only wish I were around for that brainstorming sesh: “Hmmm … Native American werewolf … Mexican … American … art student?” Also, Christian is a gorgeous 27-year-old (okay) “tycoon” (hahahaha, double “okay”) who never seems to do any work, but he also doesn’t bang models or do drugs. Disbelief unsuspended.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-041d637856898574bdbe237614161ab8-12-0-0@published data-word-count=110><b>The Technology</b>: I don’t mean the fact that real, free, actually sexy porn and literature is available literally everywhere. <i>Fifty Shades of Grey</i> takes place in 2011 but is loaded with anachronism. Anastasia is a college student who doesn’t have a computer or a smartphone. (And is a beautiful sex positive feminist virgin, but I guess we’re letting that one slide.) In one scene, Christian tracks her down to a club by, uh, GPSing her cell. He flies a helicopter too? And has a butler? Oh! And at one point, the hip young kids all groove down to Kings of Leon. ROFL, E.L. Fudge. I mean James. I mean mom.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-041d637856898574bdbe237614161ab8-13-0-0@published data-word-count=77><b>The Kink</b>: I get that this is supposed to be BDSM Lite for people with Aztec-pattern Kindle Fire covers, but the ideas about “alternative lifestyle” sex (<a href=#>James’s actual words</a>) are kind of hilarious. It’s like it was all filtered through that sexually precocious but ultimately clueless friend from Catholic elementary school: Oh, yeah, S&M is all burgundy leather dungeons and sub-dom contracts. Also, if you spray Mountain Dew in your vagina after sex you won’t get pregnant.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-041d637856898574bdbe237614161ab8-14-0-0@published data-word-count=6><b>Darfur</b>: Darfur comes up a lot.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-041d637856898574bdbe237614161ab8-15-0-0@published data-word-count=109>I’m not going to condemn <i>Fifty Shades of Grey</i> because it’s fan fiction, even though that may not be my particular cup of Klingon sperm. I’m not even going to condemn it because I’ve seen better storytelling in an evening news segment about a raccoon who got a peanut butter jar stuck on his head in a Wendy’s parking lot. What I do take issue with is that an author is making money off of people who are too technologically illiterate to find GOOD porn out there and are getting stuck with this nonsense instead because it’s the one part of Computers they can’t just ask a nephew about.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-041d637856898574bdbe237614161ab8-16-0-0@published data-word-count=43>I guess if you’ve managed to familiarize yourself with your e-reader but not YouPorn, well-written erotica, or your own body, congratulations on “finding<i>” Fifty Shades of Grey</i> … but also for going one more day without stumbling into a zoo enclosure.
