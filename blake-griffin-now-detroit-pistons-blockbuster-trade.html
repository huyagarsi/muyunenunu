At the time of the trade, the Clippers were sitting in the 8th seed in the Western Conference.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>When he re-signed this offseason, Griffin said: "I want my legacy to be a Clipper." He's moving on after eight-plus seasons in L.A., finishing his career averaging 21.6 points, 9.3 rebounds, and 4.2 assists.</span></p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-247140 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/GettyImages-909013602.jpg alt width=900 height=715 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-247140 class=wp-caption-text>Harry How/Getty Images</p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Griffin's deal did not include a no-trade clause, so he didn't have to approve this trade. Griffin's contract has $170 million remaining on it – Reed, Johnson, Harris, Bradley, and Marjanovic's deals combined just have $56.3 million.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>The trade also opened up a $7 million exception for the Pistons, which will last for one year. It could be critical in helping the Pistons bring in another complementary piece to pair with a roster that now stars Griffin alongside <a href=# title="Andre Drummond Net Worth">Andre Drummond</a>, <a href=# title="Reggie Jackson Net Worth">Reggie Jackson</a>, and Stanley Johnson.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>The biggest question mark, of course, is Griffin's health. He broke his left kneecap and missed his entire first year. The next season, technically Griffin's rookie year, he won Rookie of the Year, was selected as an All-Star and won the Slam Dunk contest.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>But that's the only time Griffin has played all 82 games in a season. He's missed at least 15 games in half of his eight seasons, and he's already missed more than 15 this year. His injuries have been about as varied as any player ever, including back spasms, a torn left quad, a broken hand, a broken toe, a staph infection, a sprained left MCL, a concussion, and surgery on his right knee.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>If Griffin can return to&nbsp;his peak All-Star level, the Pistons can contend for a top-four spot in the East and maybe even threaten for the Eastern Conference title in a down year for the conference. But if Griffin continues to miss major time, the Pistons may have just signed themselves up for five years of mediocrity.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcL%2FPqKmtq12jsri%2FjpujmqOVYrSztcWfoKdlnqTEbrDEramooaRivaq%2F06ilrGWSobykt8Guqq2domLBs63DnmY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
