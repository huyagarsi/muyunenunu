When I go home, I literally have 6 cups a day. It just doesn’t taste the same in New York, you can’t get the same right type of milk,” she said. “A cup of tea solves everything, if you are happy have a cup of tea, if you are feeling sad have a cup of tea!”</p><p><b>She</b> <b>Is</b> <b>a</b> <b>Ballerina</b><br>Before getting into modeling, Graham trained in ballet while growing up. “I trained in ballet and theatre for 12 years,” she told the magazine. “I started ballet when I was 6 and it really had a massive effect on my confidence – it made a more confident person! It made me into the woman I am today.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><b>She</b> <b>Was</b> <b>Bullied</b> <b>for</b> <b>Her</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Locks</b><br>While Graham found herself on the dance floor, school was more difficult for her because she was teased for having red hair. “Like most red heads, I did get bullied at school because we just stand out. I was this skinny little geeky thing with no boobs, but now I have embraced it as a woman,” she said. “Having red hair is now a powerful part of my identity. It took me a long time to get here, I have gone through so much in the last ten years both in terms of my career and my life.”</p><p><b>She’s</b> <b>Been</b> <b>Modeling</b> <b>for</b> <b>11</b> <b>Years</b><br>Graham began her modeling career in 2008 when she was one of the winners of the 2008 Ford modeling competition and snagged a beauty contract with Maybelline and shot an editorial for Another Magazine. Since then, she has appeared in &nbsp;<i>Glamour</i>, <i>Teen</i> <i>Vogue</i>, <i>Harper’s</i> <i>Bazaar</i> <i>Serbia</i>, <i>Marie</i> <i>Claire</i> <i>Russia</i>, <i>InStyle</i>, <i>WWD</i>, <i>Vogue</i> <i>Italia</i> and more. Graham has also strutted her stuff down the runway for Balmain, Emporio Armani, Brandon Maxwell, Etam, Jean-Paul Gaultier and in the Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show in 2017 and 2018.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Alexina-Graham-1067898020.jpg><p><b>Adriana</b> <b>Lima</b> <b>and</b> <b>Candice</b> <b>Swanepoel</b> <b>Inspire</b> <b>Her</b><br>When it comes to her inspiration, Graham looks to <a href=#><b>Adriana</b> <b>Lima</b></a>, <a href=#>who recently retired her wings</a>, and Swanepoel. “Looking at the runway now as an adult I feel so inspired by the women. I have been watching the show online since I was 16 years old,” she explained. “Adriana Lima has been such a great inspiration for me. She’s got a family, she’s mother, a model and she’s just kept on going for so many years. I love Candice too. She’s so down to earth and I mean, her body is amazing!”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX5a5psTIp5hmn6KWtaK5jJ%2BYnKyjYryvedOhnGamlayytMCMr6CcrJ%2BntqK%2FjKycnKqVqXqiusaeo2g%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
