Cindy Crawford made it a Gerber date night on Thursday, Feb. 5, for the screening of Hospital in the Sky in New York City. In tow were the supermodel’s entrepreneur husband Rande Gerber, aspiring model daughter Kaia, and her rising photographer son Presley — and clearly, good looks run in the family!  
The look-alike quartet looked radiant on the red carpet. While Gerber, 52, sported a black leather jacket, a denim shirt, and jeans, and the 49-year-old legendary model looked striking in a navy wrap dress with knee-high boots, their beautiful children stole the spotlight."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Seriously, from her gorgeous wavy brown tresses to her porcelain skin, the teen really lucked out in the genetics department.&nbsp;<strong>Presley</strong>, 15, took a night off from his photography sessions, and stepped in front of the lens in a blue sweatshirt, a black puffer coat, and denim jeans.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>In June 2014, the couple’s children teamed up for a photography project that sometimes called for <strong>Kaia</strong> to raid her mother’s closet for designer wear.&nbsp;The amazing photo shoots eventually <a href=#>landed Kaia a feature in Teen Vogue</a>.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/kaia-presley-gerber-inline.jpg><p>The event was in celebration of Orbis International, a nonprofit organization that works to prevent and treat blindness around the world. “I loved the idea that not only do they go in and provide much needed eye care for places, but they also teach the local doctors, so once they leave there’s a program in place so their work can continue,” Crawford told <strong><a href=#>Us Weekly</a>.</strong></p><p>“This journey was about me learning about Orbis and just celebrating what they do because so much of what they do, all the money is donated, and then all the doctors and nurses are volunteer. It’s really an incredible organization.”&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmqq2xnJp8r7HWrGacoZ6Zxm6v0Zqun6eimXqzscNmmpqqoJrBbrDArp6hrJWneqytyJpkrKeeYr2zsdKlnLJloJ28tbvSZmlpaWVrfw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
