According to Real Housewives of New York star Alex McCord, fellow castmate Kelly Bensimon‘s erratic behavior documented on Thursday’s episode was nothing compared to unseen footage left on the cutting room floor.
“It was much more [crazy] in real life,” McCord tells Usmagazine.com of Bensimon’s freakouts during a group vacation on St. John’s. “Much more crazy!” McCord claims that the editing actually made Bensimon look “better.”"><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

It was in the middle of the soup course!” McCord tells <strong>Us</strong>. “That wasn’t the first time that had happened. Throughout the trip, it just came out of the blue.”</p><p>Although McCord and pals <strong>Sonja Morgan</strong>, Frankel and <strong>Ramona Singer</strong> initially found Bensimon’s outbursts amusing, they quickly realized her tantrums were no laughing matter.</p><p>“Sonja was the one who pegged it at one point, saying, ‘Wow. We’re dealing with someone who is not being rational. We have to stop,'” McCord explains. “There was definitely a moment when we all clicked into realizing we had to stop picking part all the insane things being said because there’s a reason beyond anyone’s control, beyond her control.”</p><p>Bensimon, 42, sees the situation a bit differently. On Friday, she told New York magazine’s <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Vulture</strong></a>: “Some people are like, ‘You had a breakdown,’ and I’m like, no, I had a breakthrough!”</p><p>And even though the trip took place back in November, McCord and her castmates remain mystified by Bensimon’s disturbing behavior.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>VIDEO: Watch Kelly Bensimon take Us backstage at New York Fashion Week</p><p>“We’ve all talked after we saw the episode,” McCord recalls. “We just said, ‘Are you seeing what I’m seeing? Are we on the same planet?’ When things that happen that are that irrational, you think it’s you. We thought maybe our memories had distorted. But when [my husband] <strong>Simon</strong> saw it he said, ‘Okay.
