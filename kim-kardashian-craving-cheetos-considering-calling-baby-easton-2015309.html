The mom-to-be spoke to Ellen DeGeneres (in a clip which will air later today, on Wednesday, Sept. 30), about her future son and what she and husband Kanye West are thinking of naming him.
And while the 34-year-old reality star isn't eager to go with another directional name, she did admit to having a soft spot for Easton."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Easton West,” she admitted while talking to DeGeneres. “I don't think my husband likes that name, but I do like it. I don't think we'll go another direction. It's definitely not South, every time someone says South, I just want to roll my eyes," she said. "I do like Easton, but I don't think Kanye likes Easton, I'm not sure."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>But while baby names are yet to be finalized, one thing this future mom-of-two is sure about, is what she wants to eat: Cheetos! And sharing a hilarious montage of Instagram snaps on Tuesday, Sept. 29, Kardashian made it quite clear just how serious her pregnancy craving had become.</p><p>The pictures, which showed her almost seductively devouring the bright orange snack, then licking her fingers to make sure every last bit of Cheetos dust is consumed, are totally hilarious. And West’s wife was evidently having a lot of fun sharing her latest pregnancy craving with her fans.</p><p>"Craving Cheetos!" she captioned the snaps, which required no further explanation!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpKilo2S7psPSaKKipV2grrOwwKyfopmeYrCzrdWipaBlk52ypsDOrGScp56otqWx0aKloGWTlrmttc2gZJuZkq56pq3SraanZWJlfnZ%2Fj3I%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
