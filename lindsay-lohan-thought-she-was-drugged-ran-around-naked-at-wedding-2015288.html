During a Friday night fete before the couple’s nuptials, Lohan, 29, changed her outfit four times."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

After Etzin (the consul general and ambassador of tourism for the Seychelles) and model Zakocela exchanged their vows, Lohan took her shoes off at cocktail hour, the source notes, “which was weird considering it was a very high-profile event.”&nbsp;</p><p>Things took a turn for the worst after an announcer cracked a joke about Lohan during the reception. The witness tells<strong> Us</strong> that Lohan then rushed out and claimed she had been drugged. “She took off all her clothes and got completely naked and was running around her villa screaming that she’d been drugged.”</p><p>According to a second source, an EMT came to attend to Lohan, but the star was deemed fine. “She could walk and talk,” the insider tells <strong>Us</strong>. “She wasn’t slurring or anything. She was upset about the joke being made about her. She just wanted the attention.”</p><p>As for reports that the star wore a white dress to upstage the bride, the second insider tells <strong>Us</strong> that LiLo’s dress was actually light pink, but simply appeared white in some photos. “She was not trying to upstage the bride.” (In an Instagram shared by Lohan’s friend and fashion designer <strong>Stephen Mikhail</strong>, Lohan’s dress is visibly light pink.)</p><p>Lohan aside, Etzin and Zakocela had a night to remember during their fairy tale wedding. The bride, clad in a Mark Zunino-designed dress, and groom were even serenaded by <strong>Craig David</strong>. “It was the most spectacular wedding,” the first source tells <strong>Us</strong>. “There were 20 Cirque du Soleil performers, there was food from the Four Seasons from a Michelin-starred chef, and a fireworks show timed to the music.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaloZ6ZwKLFjKWmoZmeYsGpu9Sgn61lo52ybsPArGSdqqWctKawjKuYp2WRp7y2usNmpZqjlZl6osCMsJydnJmjtG5%2Bj2psa3BoZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
