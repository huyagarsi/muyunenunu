They won the championship in 2015, the upstart, exciting squad led by <a href=# rel=noopener>Steph Curry</a>, <a href=# rel=noopener>Klay Thompson</a>, and <a href=# rel=noopener>Draymond Green</a>.

Adding a top-five player in the league to a roster that just made history seems unfair, and…well, it kind of was.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>The Warriors breezed through the next two seasons. They won the title in 2017, losing just one game in the playoffs. They faced a bit more adversity in 2018, going down 3-2 to the Houston Rockets in the Western Conference Finals. But they won the final two games of that series and then swept the NBA Finals.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Even this past season, they nearly pulled off a threepeat, despite injuries to Durant, Thompson, and <a href=# rel=noopener>DeMarcus Cousins</a>. Instead, they lost in six to the Toronto Raptors.</span></p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-288393 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-970194364.jpg alt width=900 height=650 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-288393 class=wp-caption-text>Justin K. Aller/Getty Images</p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Now, for the first time in quite a while, the Warriors face a road of uncertainty. Durant is gone. Thompson's torn ACL won't put him back on the court until the All-Star break at the earliest. Even role players like <a href=# rel=noopener>Andre Iguodala</a> and <a href=# rel=noopener>Shaun Livingston</a> have left.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Despite all that uncertainty, the Warriors remain one of the most valuable teams in professional sports. According to Forbes, they're now worth $3.5 billion.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>That's a 13 percent change from last season, which is impressive enough on its own. But let's jump back to 2010, when <a href=# rel=noopener>Joe Lacob</a> and <a href=# rel=noopener>Peter Guber</a> bought the Warriors.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Lacob's ownership group spent $450 million for the team. That's an increase of about 677 percent in less than a decade!</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>In terms of growth over the past ten years, the Warriors are certainly among the top of professional sports franchises. It's a recipe other teams try to emulate, but few are able to succeed: multiple marketable stars, sustained success, and perhaps just as important, a sense of stability.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>The values of sports teams continue to rise. No one's climb has been more impressive than the Warriors.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcL%2FPqKmtq12jsri%2Fjq2fnmWXpLmlsc1mqq2ZpJp6uK3Rq6CoqqNixKa%2BxGaZqK2XncFuss6rZG1tYGK6qrjLoqanZZ6eu6Z52J6Yq6tdlrSweceeqZ6rXZ28uHnMrpqhZaSdsrq%2BxGauqKqknXq1u8OasGg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
