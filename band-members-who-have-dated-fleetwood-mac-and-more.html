“I broke up with Lindsey [Buckingham] in 1976. We’d only been in Fleetwood Mac for a year and a half, and we were breaking up when we joined Fleetwood Mac,” Stevie Nicks recalled in a February 2022 conversation with The New Yorker. “So, we just put our relationship kind of back together, because I was smart enough to know that, if we had broken up the second month of being in Fleetwood Mac, it would have blown the whole thing."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Fleetwood Mac is perhaps the most famous example of <a href=#>bandmates dating each other</a> — and the ensuing complications that come with it.</p><p>“I broke up with <a href=#><strong>Lindsey [Buckingham]</strong></a> in 1976. We’d only been in Fleetwood Mac for a year and a half, and we were breaking up when we joined Fleetwood Mac,” <a href=#><strong>Stevie Nicks</strong></a> recalled in a February 2022 conversation with <a href=# rel=noopener>The New Yorker</a>. “So, we just put our relationship kind of back together, because I was smart enough to know that, if we had broken up the second month of being in Fleetwood Mac, it would have blown the whole thing.”</p><p>The Arizona native continued: “I just bided my time, and tried to make everything as easy as possible, tried to be as sweet and nice to Lindsey as I could be. <a href=#>He wasn’t happy, either</a>. Then something happened that was, you know, ‘We’re done.’ And he knew it. It was time. And the band was solid, by that time, so I could walk away knowing that he was safe. And that the band was safe. And that we could work it out.”</p><p>The duo’s <a href=#>breakup provided inspiration</a> for the group’s critically acclaimed 1977 album, Rumours. Nicks and Buckingham penned “Dreams” and “Go Your Own Way” about each other for the LP, respectively.</p><p>“Both songs kind of mean the same thing — it’s really about our breakup,” Nicks said. “He’s <a href=#>looking at it from a very unpleasant, angry way</a>, and I’m saying, in my more airy-fairy way, we’re gonna be all right. We’ll get through this.”</p><p>Other bandmates’ relationships have stood the test of time. When <a href=#><strong>Bruce Springsteen</strong></a> invited <a href=#><strong>Patti Scialfa</strong></a> to join his E Street Band on tour as a backup singer in 1984, the “Born in the USA” musician was still married to <strong>Julianne Phillips</strong>. Springsteen and Phillips separated in 1998 and the Grammy Award winner began living with Scialfa soon afterward.</p><p>In a 1996 interview with The Advocate, <a href=#>the “Thunder Road” singer opened up</a> about receiving backlash for starting a new relationship before his divorce was finalized.</p><p>“It’s a strange society that <a href=#>assumes it has the right to tell people whom they should love</a> and whom they shouldn’t. But the truth is, I basically ignored the entire thing as much as I could. I said, ‘Well, all I know is this feels real, and maybe I have got a mess going [on] here in some fashion, but that’s life,’” he told the outlet at the time.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The New Jersey native married Scialfa in 1991.
