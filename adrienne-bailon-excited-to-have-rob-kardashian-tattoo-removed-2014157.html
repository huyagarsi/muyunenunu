Five years after their breakup, <strong>Adrienne Bailon</strong> is finally getting <strong><a href=#>Rob Kardashian</a></strong>'s name removed from her body. The Real talk show host has tried before to have the tattoo erased, but both attempts were unsuccessful. This one, she hopes—using a new technology called the PicoSure Laser—will at last do the trick.</p><p>"I have not been in a relationship with Rob for six years, and I've been with my current boyfriend, [Roc Nation's Lenny S.], for five years. I think it's time to remove it," Bailon, 30, tells <strong><a href=#>Us Weekly</a></strong> of the tattoo. "I think it's always been time, but there wasn't a procedure that I was sure would not only remove it properly but also not leave me with a worse situation than I started with."&nbsp;</p><p>The Cheetah Girls alum first got the body art during her relationship with Kardashian, which lasted from 2007 to 2009. He, too, commemorated their romance with some permanent ink—her name on his left ribcage, which she says has since been erased.</p><p>"I was genuinely in love with him and thought, 'If he's going to do this, I'm going to do this, too,'" she recalls, noting that they're still "super cool with each other." Afterward, she realized she wasn't a "tattoo girl"—but it was too late. Now, she's finally ready to put the past behind her.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>"I'm so excited, you don't understand," she tells <strong>Us</strong>. "The other day I ran across some pictures of myself in a bathing suit that had Brazilian high-cut bottoms, pre-Rob tattoo, and I couldn't wait to wear those again because they looked so cute."&nbsp;</p><p>This is not the first time Bailon has spoken about her regrets over the tattoo. Back in 2013, during an episode of The Real, she called it the "ratchet-iest booty tattoo" and said she didn't know what she was thinking when she got it. "It's awful," she said at the time. "I made a very bad decision."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmmZ6ZpanGcLrEsKpomZSntqa6zZ5km5mZobyvecSxmqKslZl6tbuMoZivnV2nvKN5ypqpnZmjnbaiuoytmK2sn6R6s7HMqK2enF1nfXKAkG5u</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
