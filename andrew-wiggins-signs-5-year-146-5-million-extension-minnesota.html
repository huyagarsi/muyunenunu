And in a season in which many expect his team, the Minnesota Timberwolves, to be one of the most improved teams in the league, the Wolves have signed the rising star to a long term extension.</p><p>Andrew Wiggins signed a 5-year, $146.5 million max contract extension with the Wolves that will have him locked in until 2023. The contract is a straight five-year deal that does not include a player option. Despite signing the contract this week, the Wolves offered him the extension back in August. A part of why the deal took so long to get done is because Wiggins decided to fire his longtime agent <a href=# title="Billy Duffy Net Worth">Billy Duffy</a> shortly after the team offered him the contract, essentially opting to sign the contract without an agent.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-234961 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/GettyImages-859058950.jpg alt width=900 height=600 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-234961 class=wp-caption-text>(Zhong Zhi/Getty Images)</p><p>When talking about the deal and why he signed it, Wiggins said, "I like everyone from the trainers to the coaches to the front office, my teammates… I love everybody. They've treated me with nothing but nice since I got here. And they were the first people who gave me the opportunity to play in the NBA after I got traded from Cleveland and they welcomed me with open arms. So this is where I wanted to be at."</p><p>Wiggins, who averaged 23.6 points per game last season, was slated to become a free agent at the end of the upcoming season, and would have likely had a bevy of teams competing to acquire his services, so it isn't a surprise that the Timberwolves had a desire to lock him up before that happened. Wiggins will be a major part of a Timberwolves team that already had Karl Anthony-Towns, and has added major talent to its roster, including players such as <a href=#>Jimmy Butler</a>, Jeff Teague, <a href=#>Jamal Crawford,</a> and Taj Gibson. They will look to end the team's 13-season playoff drought, the longest playoff drought in the NBA.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcL%2FPqKmtq12jsri%2FjpqlnaqVrHq4tcagoKerXai2qLrSZmxmsZWWv259k29kbmWdnrmttc6nZJ6wpJq7tLXOp2SmoZ6jsrS705pm</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
