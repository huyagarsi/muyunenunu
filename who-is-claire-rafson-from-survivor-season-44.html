Fans will be exposed to a new group of competitors who will come to the abandoned island prepared to face a variety of physical tasks in order to emerge as the competition series’ final survival. The first show of Season 44 of CBS’ Survivor will air on Wednesday, March 1, 2023, at 8 p.m. ET/ 7 p.m. CT. According to the official summary of the upcoming reality TV challenge series:</p><p>“Stranded on Fiji’s gorgeous islands, 18 determined new castaways will be split into three groups of six and compelled to create a new society as they adjust to their physical and social circumstances.”</p><p>Claire Rafson, a 25-year-old tech investor who thinks her upbeat demeanor will conceal her smart skills, is one of the candidates who will appear this season. With only a few weeks until the premiere of Season 44 of Survivor, here’s everything you need to know about Claire Rafson.</p><h2>A contestant on Survivor Season 44 Claire Rafson has been an Eniac Ventures partner since October 2021.</h2><p>Claire earned a bachelor’s degree in history and Native American studies from Dartmouth College. During her tenure at Dartmouth, she was a member of the “SHEBA Dance Ensemble (Director), Inter-Sorority Council (VP of DE&l), Academic Mentor, Sigma Delta Sorority (Executive), Rockefeller Center for Public Policy, and Dartmouth Outing Club,” according to her LinkedIn page.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Claire-Rafson-1.jpg alt="Claire Rafson" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>She presently works as an investment at Eniac Ventures. Her employment title also required her to work and “invest in potential early-stage companies,” according to her LinkedIn page.&nbsp;Claire disclosed in an exclusive conversation with Parade prior to her debut on the competition series that being on Survivor was one of her lifetime goals.&nbsp;She went on to say that she’d been waiting since she was four years old, or about 21 years now, and that she’d always wanted to give it a shot, eventually finding the confidence to register this year.</p><p>Claire described her best time in the competition’s past as follows:</p><p>“Because there are so many instances, I believe this is a bit of a cop-out. The Cook Islands was probably my greatest moment of all time. I admired how dominant the Aitu Four were. And my best moments were whenever they sent Candice to Exile Island.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Claire-Rafson-2.jpg alt="Claire Rafson" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Claire revealed one event that helped prepare her for the competition:</p><p>“I believe it is difficult, so I will compromise on this one. I believe that simply existing has been that life experience for me. (Laughs.) So, for comparison, I’m a 5’2″ gay African-Jewish lady who is boisterous as heck. So, for my entire existence, I’ve been the strange one out, and I’ve stood out like a swollen thumb everywhere I’ve gone.”</p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Claire Rafson</a> <a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Survivor Season 44</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiuoaddnsBur8uaoKudXaeup7%2FOp2Sfqp%2BierTB0a%2Bgr6eiYsCmrdKopWZsZGQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
