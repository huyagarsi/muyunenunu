A little sore is OK, but you don’t want to give yourself any excuses in the beginning to not keep on-track.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Mark-Wahlberg-Reveals-That-Hes-Gained-20-Pounds-3-Weeks-For-New-Role-002.jpg><p>The Instant Family lead admitted that “some days are easier than others” when it comes to finding the motivation to work out.</p><p>“Shocking the body and changing up the workouts helps me keep in top shape and making improvements,” Wahlberg told Us. “I also listen to my body and rest when I need it. … It is important to keep on track with your fitness and health goals and not lose momentum and slip back into a sedentary lifestyle.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>For the Entourage actor, it was all about “making fitness a habit” because he found it to be <a href=#>one of the best things a person can do</a> for both their mental and physical health.</p><p>“Join and follow fitness groups on social media and post up those selfies, diet tips and workouts! The fitness community is so engaged and supportive and you will stay inspired seeing others making progress!” the Patriots Day actor said. “It also helps inspire others to see your fitness journey and that always feels great. … Sharing your goals makes you more likely to keep reaching for them, so don’t be afraid to post about your healthy habits and ambitions on social media and tell your friends and family, you may even inspire them or pick up a workout buddy!”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZJunlK58r7HWrGammaKgeritx6WZnqqXYr%2BmwsSao6xlpJ2utXnHnqpmn5Geu6awjGtnZqifqrulv4yipWZrXayyprfSZqeim6Nk</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
