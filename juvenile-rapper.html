In 1997 Solja Rags, Juvenile’s debut album with Cash Money Records, was released. It became popular among local rap audiences, and also saw some national success as it charted on the Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. It was the first time he worked with Cash Money in-house producer Mannie Fresh, who would go on to produce all of Juvenile’s albums on Cash Money in their entirety except Juve the Great.

The second Hot Boys group album, Guerrilla Warfare also came out and was successful, being certified Platinum. Over the next few years Juvenile released two more solo albums for Cash Money: Tha G-Code in 1999 being certified Double Platinum, and Project English in 2001 being certified Platinum. These albums each were very successful as they both reached the top 10 of the Billboard Hot 200, but they did not match the success of 400 Degreez. UTP Records had promised an album titled 600 Degreez but it never materialized.</p><p>Juvenile’s next album, titled 400 Degreez, was released in 1998. It was his breakout to the national rap scene. The Cash Money label now had joint distribution by Universal Records, which gave the music much more national promotion. This along with much more critically praised music made Juvenile a mainstream star. The album’s first single “Ha” and later “Back That Azz Up” both became very successful songs charting on the Billboard Hot 100 and the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. Powered by these two singles, 400 Degreez was eventually certified 4X platinum by the RIAA. It is his best selling album to date. However, there came a dispute over who owned the rights to the title of “Back That Azz Up”, as another New Orleans performer DJ Jubilee claimed that Juvenile’s song sounded very similar to a song of his. In January 2005, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in New Orleans denied the case.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Juvenile height</b> <strong>6 ft 0 in</strong> Juvenile <strong>weight</strong> Not Known & <strong>body measurements</strong> will update soon.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Height</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>6 ft 0 in</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Weight</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Body Measurements</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Eye Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Hair Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Feet/Shoe Size</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Juvenile’s debut album, Being Myself, was released in 1995 after signing with Warlock Records.
