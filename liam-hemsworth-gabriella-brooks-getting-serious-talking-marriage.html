I don’t get off on drama or fighting,” she told <a href=#><strong>Howard Stern</strong> </a>in December 2020, noting that “there was too much conflict” in their marriage. “Sometimes you miss people more than others, and sometimes, things get easier. Time kind of heals all, but that was at a time where I felt really strong.
