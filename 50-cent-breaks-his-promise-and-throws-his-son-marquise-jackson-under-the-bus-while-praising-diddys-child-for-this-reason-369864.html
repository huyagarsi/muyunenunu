The rapper has been making the rounds promoting his new show on ABC called For Life, and he was asked about his oldest son. He drove into Marquise Jackson, whom he has disowned.
50 Cent was asked by Ebro if he is willing to sit down with Marquise and he said this: “I haven’t even experienced the teenage boy thing."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

He drove into Marquise Jackson, whom he has disowned.</p><p>50 Cent was asked by Ebro if he is willing to sit down with Marquise and he said this: “I haven’t even experienced the teenage boy thing. He drifted before that. He and his mom were already –, but that’s his mom’s child. Do you know what I mean? That’s his mom’s child.”</p><p>Ebro asked: “Now, he comes back, and he wants to have a conversation. I’ll listen. Maybe go to lunch or dinner somewhere, but he’ll pay for it. He’s a man now. He’s a grown man.”</p><p>50 did talk about his other son Sir and confessed he wants a daughter. Fans are bashing the rapper for his behavior.</p><p>One person said: “I don’t care how mad I get with the mother of my child, and I’ll never turn my back on my kids. So much for changing his ways after the passing of Kobe… I gave it a few months…🙄”</p><p>Another commenter claimed: “His son threw HIM out his life🤣🤣 or mostly him. So yea, he should pay cuz he still holds a grudge on his own pops.”</p><p>This follower stated: “Hard to judge a man when you haven’t walked in his shoes, 50 no dummy tho, and seeing how he treats his other child, I truly believe his oldest son’s moms poisoned his mind well before 50 had a chance to raise that kid. If you wanna act that confrontational and try to sabotage your dad by linking with his enemy’s, I get why 50 have to test his son this way if they’re to talk.”</p><p></p><p>50 did have good things to say about Diddy’s son, Quincy, who is a cast member on one of his shows.</p><p>He claimed: “His son, Quincy. He’s cast in one of the shows. It ain’t got nothing to do with Puffy. His work got him in it, you know? He has been workin’, doin’ his thing.”</p><p>He added: “I would never not work with Puffy’s kids or anybody around that. Like, if we had an issue, it’s an issue between him and me, and we’ll talk about it. I’m not gon’ mess with nobody kids. That’s Yayo with the slap your kids type of thing.”</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>50 Cent has a lot of things going on at the moment.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGdlZXqksc2tZJuqlZa4tHnHoqpmqKKkuqq%2FxGaYp5xdqbWzu9asZKGho2LAsLqMppirqaWewKZ5yZqapKufo3q2usOeqWasmJp6o8HSZq6hoZyaerG%2BwKKqoqaXYrGqsMOyqmabmJ65pXnFqKlmrJiewG6%2BxJqqqKZdaIN6hJVtZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
