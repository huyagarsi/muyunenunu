Fury of the Gods, here is what you need to know.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-is-shazam-fury-of-the-gods-suitable-for-children data-injectable=false>Is Shazam! Fury of the Gods suitable for children?&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=659 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=188 data-current-count=188 data-injectable=false>Shazam! Fury of the Gods&nbsp;has been given a PG-13 rating by the Motion Picture Association Of America, which means the board believes the film is unsuitable for children under 13.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=327 data-current-count=515 data-injectable=true>International rating boards have come to a similar conclusion, with many giving a film their equivalent of a PG-13 rating. The U.K. board gave the film a 12A certificate, and Mexico gave it a B rating. Canada has given the film a PG rating, meaning that its board believes&nbsp;Shazam! 2&nbsp;isn’t suitable for younger children.</p><p data-characters=452 data-current-count=452 data-injectable=true><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Common Sense Media</a>‘s breakdown of the film makes it clear why it had the rating it has. The movie is rated four out of five for violence, and the site’s review notes that while much of the violence is slapstick, some of the scarier and more intense fights will likely make younger children uncomfortable. It has also been given a three out of five for language, as the movie features lightly offensive words and a few censored curses.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=605 data-current-count=605 data-injectable=true>This is backed up by the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">British Board of Film Classification</a>‘s breakdown of the movie. It notes that the movie frequently features “scenes of fantastical threat” and that the fight scenes have “heavy blows, and occasional stabbings, although bloody detail is minimal.” But it does draw attention to one moment that features people being forced to jump off a building to their deaths.&nbsp;The board also noted the film features scenes depicting “emotional upset, and references to a teen being abandoned by his parents as a child and living in a foster care system.”</p><p data-characters=325 data-current-count=325 data-injectable=false>Because of all of these factors, it’s clear that&nbsp;Shazam! Fury of the Gods&nbsp;is on the lighter and sillier end of the superhero genre. However, parents with younger children or children easily disturbed by monsters or comic-book violence should use caution when deciding if&nbsp;Shazam! Fury of the Gods&nbsp;is right for you.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJooKxlo52uu63MZmlmq6WewaKuy55kn6eiYriqsNJmqqGZqpa6brLUq7Bmp5ZiwamxjKCmnatdp661tc2gZJ6woKGuqrrEnWY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
