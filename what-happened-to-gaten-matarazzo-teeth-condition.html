The reason for that is Matarazzo's character was very vocal about the fact that he was born with a birth defect.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>20 Surprising Facts About The Stranger Things Cast</a></span></p><p>While most people couldn't name the birth defect that Matarazzo and his famous character were born with, they knew it caused his teeth to come in abnormally. After all, Stranger Things' first season featured a scene in which Matarazzo's teeth were talked about.</p><p>Since Matarazzo rose to fame, he has notably been open with his fans including the time he revealed <a href=#>he'd been vaccinated</a>. As a result of Matarazzo's willingness to talk about his life and medical issues, a lot is known about what allowed the actor's teeth to look a lot different now than when fans first learned about him.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-is-gaten-matarazzo-39-s-birth-defect>What Is Gaten Matarazzo's Birth Defect?</h2><p>When people are born with a rare medical ailment of any kind, it can be very difficult for them to get the kind of treatment they need. After all, when someone is suffering from something rare, doctors often struggle to figure out what is happening, let alone treat their ailment.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Gaten Matarazzo And Other Stranger Things Stars With Musical Backgrounds</a></span></p><p>Fortunately for anyone who gets born with Cleidocranial dysostosis in the future, Gaten Matarazzo is advocating on their behalf and bringing attention to what they are going through.</p><p>A rare genetic disorder, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cleidocranial dysostosis mainly affects a person's bones and teeth</a>. In people born with the disorder, their skulls sometimes aren't fully formed at birth, their collarbones are absent or poorly developed, and they are shorter.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In terms of someone with Cleidocranial dysostosis, their teeth can be prone to cavities, they can have extras, their can be crowded, and they can fail to come out on their own.</p><p>While speaking to healthinsight.ca in the past, Matarazzo spoke about how important a person's teeth are to their overall health.</p><p>"I wish people would understand that having teeth is not cosmetic and it does affect a personâ€™s well-being and health."</p><p>"Teeth will not come in on their own and itâ€™s not just a matter of waiting because if you wait too long, the teeth could fuse to the jaw and you could never have your own teeth and then you would have to get implants."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I need people, and specifically doctors, to understand that it needs to be done through appliances and through medical procedures and not just time. Itâ€™s not always about time. Itâ€™s about working for it."</p><p>Later in the same conversation, Matarazzo also revealed that his birth defect is a source of strength for him and has provided him with many opportunities.</p><p>"Pretty much every part Iâ€™ve booked is because of the condition. In some way, it affects me â€” whether it be my height or my teeth or making me look younger."</p><p>While Matarazzo seems thankful, he does wish to find new career opportunities unrelated to his birth defect in the future.</p><p>"Hopefully, I can evolve from that and not just get roles because of the condition, I can play parts that donâ€™t have physical disabilities or anything like that. I can play someone who isnâ€™t associated with the condition."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Finally, Matarazzo expressed that he is grateful for how The Duffer Brothers handled his birth defect.</p><p>"The Duffer brothers also helped a lot, when they wrote the condition into the show. They werenâ€™t intending on having my character have the condition, but when I told them about it they liked the idea of having a character with a disability to give him more of a unique twist and make him more relatable in a way."</p><h2 id=what-happened-to-gaten-matarazzo-39-s-teeth>What Happened To Gaten Matarazzo's Teeth?</h2><p>Over the last several years, Gaten Matarazzo has made a slew of public appearances.
