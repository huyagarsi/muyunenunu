Bleacher Report @BleacherReportAngel Reese was called for a flagrant 1 for this foul on Caitlin Clark<br><br>(via <a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/CBSSports?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;>@CBSSports</a>)<a href=&#34;https://t.co/8JdiqzD2dC&#34;>pic.twitter.com/8JdiqzD2dC</a>
That provided a certain group of people on social media—the sort who are just waiting for something to get angry about, especially when it comes to Clark—the fodder they required, though the rookie point guard didn't think it was anything more than a basketball play gone slightly awry."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Just trying to make a play on the ball and get the block. It happens." &lt;a href="https://t.co/1OXIylEURh">pic.twitter.com/1OXIylEURh&lt;/a></p><p>Reese offered a similar take on the situation.</p><p>"It was a basketball play. I can't control the refs. They affected the game obviously a lot today," she <a href=# rel=noopener>told reporters</a>. "I'm always going for the ball. Y'all are going to play that clip 20 times before Monday."</p><p>Upgrading the call to a flagrant 1 was clearly the right call. Reese may have been making a natural basketball play, but she made clear contact with Clark's head in the process. That's about as deep as the situation needed to go.</p><p>But the ridiculous takes followed nonetheless.</p>Matt Leinart <span class=acct>@MattLeinartQB</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>Angel Reese should be suspended. Period.

Turnovers remain an issue, as she gave the ball away five times, but she was the best player on the court Sunday.</p><p>Reese finished with 11 points, 13 rebounds, five assists, two steals and one block, making her usual two-way impact, though she struggled from the field (4-of-13).</p><p>The rivalry between Clark and Reese continues to be zesty, dating back to their college days, but the Fever point guard embraces it.</p>Talia Goodman <span class=acct>@TaliaGoodmanWBB</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>Caitlin Clark on what draws viewers to herself + Angel Reese: &lt;br>&lt;br>"I think it's just the emotion and the passion that we play with.

"We're competitors. That's the way the game should be. It's going to get a little feisty, it's going to get physical, but at the end of the day both teams are just trying to win."</p><p>Did you hear that, hot-take provocateurs of the world?
