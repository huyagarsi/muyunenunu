One of these included a Red Lobster in the Bronx, which she was fired from for&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">discourtesy to customers</a>.

Martha speaks with a British accent, which can be heard in several songs, especially in the opening to â€˜Roman Holidayâ€™, the opening track from her 2012 album Pink Fridayâ€¦ Roman Reloaded.</p><p>However, she has pulled out the accent in different situations too. In one instance, Minaj sends a message to British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, joking that she was in fact born in the UK, and even went to university with former PM Margaret Thatcher.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ send this to the prime minister & let him know they lied on me.
