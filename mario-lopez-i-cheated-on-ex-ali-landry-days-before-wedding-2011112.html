Now, almost seven years later, Lopez fessed up to at least one major indiscretion that took place during a wild bachelor party weekend in Mexico.
Lopez, 37, spilled the beans to Howard Stern on his Sirius XM radio show on Thursday."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

That was a situation where I was not mature and man enough.”</p><p>Before heading out for his big weekend, Lopez didn’t tell then-fiancee Landry the whole truth. “I said I was going to Cabo…to go marlin fishing,” he explained. “Then my cousin surprised me and said ‘No, …we’re going on this whirlwind tour: Cabo, Acapulco, all these places.'”</p><p>Rather than telling Landry about the change of plans, “I figured at that point it was easier to ask for forgiveness [afterward]. It’s my bachelor party, we were going to have a good time. And we went, we had a good time.”</p><p>Lopez was caught in an incriminating poolside shot with another woman. “We’re partying, and somebody took a picture,” he explained. Landry’s sister eventually got a hold of that photo and shared it with her.</p><p>“I was wrong for obviously lying, and I shouldn’t have been in that position,” Lopez said.</p><p>Finally, Landry confronted him. “I dealt with all this drama, and then at that point just realize…I finally got the balls to say ‘Hey, listen I’m not ready for this, I’m sorry.'”</p><p>“At that point,” the star confessed, “I was not ready to settle down. I wasn’t man enough to know how to go about handling it. ”</p><p>Why did Lopez marry her in the first place, then? “I think when you go out for a few years you either take it to another level or you break up, right?” he said of Landry, whom he had been dating for six years. “There was nothing glaringly wrong on paper: I thought, ‘She’s beautiful, she’s a good girl, she comes from a great family, she’d make a great mom…I confused cold feet with not being ready.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Older and wiser, Lopez is more settled down these days with <strong>Courtney</strong> <strong>Mazza</strong>, his girlfriend of over two years; they welcomed daughter Gia in September.</p><p>“It worked out well,” he said. “Thank god, because I got a great girl now.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZJunlK58r7HWrGammaKevG64zqmcs2WZYrCpscCtnJ1ln6N6psSMmqOiZZyWu6W%2B2GabmrGjYq%2Bmss6rnGavlZmxqrrGZmlpaWFmfnN7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
