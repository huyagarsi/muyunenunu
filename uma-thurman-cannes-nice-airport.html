Two days previously she stole the show in a custom-made Atelier Versace cream gown as she said goodbye to Cannes in style. Stepping out on Arpad's arm, Uma was seen gazing into her partner's eyes and sharing a tender kiss with him as they hit the red carpet at the premiere. Fashionista <a class=hm-link href=#>Olivia Palermo</a> was also spotted making her way through the departure terminal on Tuesday to catch a flight home. The former MTV star, who looked super-stylish in nude flats, an A-line red, cream and black skirt, black t-shirt and studded necklace, also made a splash in Cannes.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/3b57f68c8685-olivia-palermo-z.jpg><p id=eCRdxES17F6I data-wc=135>She put her best fashion foot forward at amfAR Cinema Against AIDS 2013 charity event on Thursday evening, wearing a daring floor length leopard-print Cavalli gown with a thigh-high split. The star sat next to <a class=hm-link href=#>Kylie Minogue</a> at the event, which raised a staggering $32.3million for charity. Veteran Spice Girl Mel B looked pleased to be returning to British soil as she strutted through the airport in an all-black two piece with matching gold and black sandals. Writing on her blog before the film festival, Mel announced that her trip home was going to be a special one. "Heading to Cannes #Cinemoi and UK to see my Spices, yippeee!" said the star. Although Victoria Beckham is currently enjoying LA’s sunshine with the Beckham clan, the rest of the girls will be eagerly anticipating the Leeds-born singer’s arrival.</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
