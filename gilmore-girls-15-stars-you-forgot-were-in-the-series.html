I connected to it in the way that I connected to things I’d done in theater. It felt a little heightened. … I thought it was so unique,” the Parenthood alum said during a <a href=#>Variety Actors on Actors interview</a> in 2017, admitting that she was warned that the character would “age” her. “At the time, everybody [in] my peer group saw it as a ‘mom role,’ predominantly. … I just felt like [Lorelai] was mine.”</p><p>Scroll down to look back at some of the stars you might have forgotten were in Gilmore Girls!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2Bctq25zqucZp%2BZp7m0eZBuZKyskafAbsXOrmSfp6KcvLV51p6pnmWZo3q1tMRmqp6qmZrAcLjErKOinV2ksbC5jKOpZqmlmru1tc1mrpqko518</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
