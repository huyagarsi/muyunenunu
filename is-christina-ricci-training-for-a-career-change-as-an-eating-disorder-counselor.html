Actress CHRISTINA RICCI has set out on a new career – as an eating disorder counsellor."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

According to Star Magazine, which is not always the most reliable source, Christina is planning on changing her career from B-list actress to teen counselor.</p><p>Actress CHRISTINA RICCI has set out on a new career – as an eating disorder counsellor. [sic]</p><p>The 28-year-old star has been candid about her battle with anorexia during her teen years.</p><p>And according to reports, the New York, I Love You star has registered for a series of online classes to become a certified counsellor to girls struggling with their self-esteem.</p><p>A source tells US magazine Star, “Christina went through hell and back growing up. For years she struggled with her self-esteem, so she knows how hard it is for young girls.”</p><p>The source added that Ricci hopes “to learn how she can help them get better without having to go through all the pain she did as a child”.</p><p><a href=#>Contact Music</a></p><p>According to <a href=#>IMDB</a> Christina has at least five projects coming up from now until 2010, so I guess that she won’t be making that career change anytime soon.</p><p>While Star Magazine hasn’t got it 100% accurate in describing this as a new career, Christina might be doing that some celebrities do, and undertaking training to be a celebrity face of a youth counseling line. I’m not sure if this happens internationally but when launching these kinds of services within Australia it is not unusual to get a celebrity to help promote the service. The celebrity is required to undertake the same training as the telephone operators in order to be able to talk knowledgeably about the service.</p><p>I just can’t see Christina giving up her multi-million dollar acting career to counsel youth, but it is wonderful that she is willing to do this. My sister is a counselor for child victims of domestic violence, and says that staff generally last a year in the job before moving onto something less draining. It has to be a true calling to be able to listen to and support a person who is a stranger to you, and take on a small part of their problems.</p><p>Christina Ricci is shown out on 7/9/08.
