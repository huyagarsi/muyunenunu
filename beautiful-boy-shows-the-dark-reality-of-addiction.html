Based on two memoirs, one from&nbsp;acclaimed journalist David Sheff and one from his son, Nic Sheff. As Nic repeatedly relapses, the Sheffs are&nbsp;faced with the harsh reality that addiction is a disease that does not discriminate and can hit any family at&nbsp;any time.</p><p>The movie tackles the current opioid crisis, which is explained by the medical science where crystal meth destroys and alters the brain function and how getting clean statistically is “in the single digits.”</p><p>The movie stars Steve Carell as David Sheff, the dad who is trying everything he can to help his son, Nic Sheff who is portrayed by Timothée Chalamet, end his addiction and helps him recover. Nic is a college student who descends into heavy duty drug use and skips college for rehab, relapses then recovers and then again relapses. The Dad is there concerned, empathetic and helpless. It’s a dark movie that will move everyone in one way or the other.</p><p>Steve Carell, who plays the father, told&nbsp;CelebMix the message he has for parents who are going through this same situation with their own children. “I feel like it would be cavalier of me to send off a message because I’m not an authority on the subject. I’ve spoken to a lot of parents and I’ve spoken to, as we were shooting this, people of the crew, people that we met along the way and people that just happen to be there. So many of them related their personal stories and many of them tragic. I stop short of saying well there’s hope, because that sounds glib. I think it’s such a national epidemic right now and tragedy that I think the hope lies in the discussion, the hope lies in kind of dispelling some of the myths about addiction, that it doesn’t discriminate, it can affect anyone at anytime. I feel like giving conversations like that, giving addiction sort of a context, that’s the greatest hope for the people who are affected by it.”</p><p>Make sure to catch the important movie which is in theaters everywhere now.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7nIsWWcp51kr6at1K2gn62cYq%2BwxYysn6ivo2LBqbGMnZiro12nsqK4yK2wZqeWYq6lsMicq6KnnmQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
