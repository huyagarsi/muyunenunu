And it has since been used for characters on such TV shows as diverse as The Waltons, The Cosby Show, Sesame Street, Grey's Anatomy and Law & Order: Special Victims Unit. Not to mention the super popular children's book series, Olivia the Pig.</p><p>For years it was associated first with Gone With the Wind's <strong>Olivia de Havilland</strong>, and then with Australian-born singer <strong>Olivia Newton-John</strong>.</p><p>Olivia has been popular in the United States since at least 1880 (it was the name of <strong>Mark Twain</strong>'s wife), but never has been as wildly prevalent as it is today. Olivia currently ranks at No. 3 on the Social Security list of top baby names, given to more than 17,000 baby girls last year.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Its widespread popularity extends to Britain, where it was No. 1 in 2006 and 2008, as it was in several areas of Canada; it's also in the Top 10 in Australia, New Zealand, and Finland.</p><p>Nor will Ms. Van Der Beek be the only Olivia in the celebrisphere. Other notables who have chosen the name include J<strong>ustine Bateman</strong>, <strong>Chelsea Noble</strong> and <strong>Kirk Cameron</strong>, <strong>Joely Fisher,</strong> <strong>Wanda Sykes</strong>, <strong>Lori Loughlin</strong>, <strong>Byron Allen</strong>, <strong>Eddie Vedder</strong>, Joe Piscopo, Beverly DeAngelo and <strong>Al Pacino</strong>, and <strong>Denzel Washington</strong>.</p><p>No middle name has been announced for this Olivia, but with seven syllables in her first and last names, that may well have seemed like enough.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGawoJGpwG61zWaYZqaRorJutsCmnKxlppa7brDEq2SbnZWgwG6wwK6eoayVp3qwuMivoJplYmV%2BcX6YcmY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
