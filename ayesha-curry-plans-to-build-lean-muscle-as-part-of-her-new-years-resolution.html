And so I was almost always defeated in whatever it was that I was doing because I couldn’t do it to that level. I think I had to take a second, take a deep breath and just realize, do what you can and that’s enough.”&nbsp;</p><p>Kicking off her New Year health journey, Curry partnered <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">with</a> MyFitnessPal for its 14-day Jumpstart Your Health Challenge.
