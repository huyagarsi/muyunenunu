So, it started as that. It started as, how do we <a href=#>give people some escape</a>. I had this imagining of a beach motif throughout the season, and I called Ellen, and I said, what if we bring back, I don’t know, <a href=#>some dead character that you could dream</a> of on the beach, that would be so fun for the fans.”</p><p>Grey’s Anatomy airs on ABC Thursdays at 9 p.m. ET.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJ6rnamoeqK6wK2mprGjYrCiucilo5plnKqxpbXNoKuopl2psqK%2FxKxknKqRr8Zuwc2er6mdk6mypXnRnquuqp6ofA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
