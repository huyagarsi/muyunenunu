One of many famous facets of the late musician’s style was his memorable sunglasses collection, as depicted in Baz Luhrmann’s Elvis biopic — in theaters now, starring Austin Butler.
“Elvis was really into sunglasses,” says costume and production designer Catherine Martin in an exclusive interview with Us Weekly’s Stylish."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

In reality, they were a shiny, chrome finish, but we made them have a rougher texture so that when you photographed it, you could actually read the ‘EP’ initial.”</p><p>“We wanted Elvis’s style to be respected and for it to be an interpretation, not an imitation,” says Martin. It’s safe to say that she and the team nailed it.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX6jCr7PLmqqsnaNitq95xKWtoqtdnru1sdGvoJ6vXay2tbSMnKasrKWism6wxKygoKaVp3qkrdOhnKuhnpp6rq3RraCnZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
