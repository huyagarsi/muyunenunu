Moreover, a lot of people noticed his fake Dior "Drio" jacket for his interview on <a href=# class=text-word rel>N.O.R.E.</a> and DJ EFN's Drink Champs. While this isn't an outright lie, it did prompt people to question whether this was a legitimate choice or if he just never noticed that the letters were flipped. Regardless, we now know, at least according to the Senegal-raised artist, this was all part of the plan to garner more interest in his interview. When speaking to <a href=# class=text-word rel>French Montana</a>, he answered his question about the jacket in earnest (hopefully).</p><p>"I knew I knew that s**t was going to raise engagement," Akon responded to French Montana's style inquiries. Furthermore, the 50-year-old singer said that he got the jacket from "one of [his] Africans." "It just takes for one person to notice, and it’s gone’ go cr*zy on the internet," he continued.

"But there was nothing for me to survive. Because my parents was actually really wealthy. I was living in New Jersey. We lived in a three-story house, just me and my older brother. So when I think about it, we were just bored as hell.</p><p>"I think a lot of my choices came from wanting to be accepted, you know?" he continued. "So that’s how I got caught into all the things that I got caught into, including cars. Because cars made me feel special. I was young, I could drive with the most elite vehicles, and I ran with the scenario that I was an African prince. After&nbsp;Coming to America, I was like, 'S***iiit!' That’s what motivated it!"
