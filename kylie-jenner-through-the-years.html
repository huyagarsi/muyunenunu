No longer known simply as the daughter of Kris and Caitlyn Jenner or the little sister of Kourtney, Khloé, Kim and Kendall, Kylie is a serious force to be reckoned with in her own right.
In March 2019, she became the world’s youngest “self-made billionaire” thanks to her uber-successful business ventures in makeup, with Kylie Cosmetics, and fashion, with Kendall + Kylie."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

(Although&nbsp;Forbes <a href=#>later revoked the title</a>, estimating in May 2020 that she is actually worth just under $900 million.)</p><p>Further cementing Kylie’s place in history was her own spinoff series on E!, Life of Kylie, and her undeniable social media footprint. Kylie boasted more than 140 million followers on Instagram alone in August 2019, and as of July 2019, the multihyphenate was reportedly taking in a <a href=#>whopping $1.2 million per Instagram post</a>. By August 2022, she had amassed 365 million followers on the platform.</p><p>The businesswoman has also managed to captivate the world with her personal life. Kylie has kept tongues wagging with high-profile relationships with rapper <a href=#><strong>Tyga</strong></a>, whom she dated on and off from <a href=#>2015</a> to <a href=#>2017</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=#><strong>Travis Scott</strong></a>, whom she <a href=#>began dating</a> in April of 2017. She went on to <a href=#>welcome her first child</a>, daughter, <a href=#>Stormi Webster</a>, with Scott in February 2018.</p><p>Prior to becoming a mom, she also had the world guessing about her pregnancy status, keeping mum even after Us Weekly <a href=#>confirmed her big news</a> in September 2017.</p><p>The on-again, off-again couple announced their split in October 2019 but later reconciled. They announced two years later that baby No. 2 was on the way, going on to welcome a baby boy in February 2022.</p><p>“They are so in love with each other,” a source exclusively told&nbsp;Us&nbsp;in December 2021. “They share a special bond as parents that no one else can touch. They are very mature about their relationship and know that they both have their own careers and allow each other that space, but at the same time, they are both extremely hands on and keep their family at the forefront at all times. They are both super engaged when it comes to family and work really well as parents together. They are very streamlined.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The insider added at the time: “Kylie has never felt more prepared for something in her entire life. Kylie and Travis are so elated to be on this journey again together.”</p><p>Scroll down to relive the makeup mogul’s biggest moments through the years!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkuLq4yJ5ko52eo7KzedOhqaitl516tbTEZrCemaKofA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
