We’re a lot alike, so it is really easy for us to collaborate. … We’re constantly just feeding off each other, or, giving each other little ideas, little bars here and there, and like, ‘Oh, maybe you shouldn’t say that. Maybe you should say it a little more like this.’”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Aiko went on to gush about her beau in March. “happy birthday to the most talented, hardworking, anime, dc, marvel, movie, tv show nerd 🥰 you are the GOAT !! a living light and a living legend 🤩 you’re a major source of inspiration and joy for everyone lucky enough to know you 🥲i hope 34 is your best year yet and you get everything you wish for 🥰 you deserve it ✨ i love you 💙,” she <a href=#>shared via Instagram</a>.</p><p>Big Sean, meanwhile, <a href=#>posted a compilation of photos</a> from <a href=#>Coachella&nbsp;</a>in April, almost all including Aiko. “Life is as fun as it looks out in the dessert @jheneaiko 🌵🤟🏾🌐💫🖤,” the rapper wrote.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGajoJWjsm6tyKSmZpqZnHq0scCnZLCdnJi8rrGMrZ%2BeoaJifrTAjJyfoqSUYsGws8Stn56qXaW2pHs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
