And I know that’s inclusive, but if you look at them like episodes of television, I can just say the words, “Star Wars,” because I think it is a great depiction of the classic story of good vs. evil.</p><p>The same could be said about&nbsp;The Matrix movies, all three. A lot of people will be like, “Well, no, just the first one, because the other two weren’t to my fancy.” I liked all three because I like the entire story. What a unique concept that the world is completely fake, and amazing to think that machines could be running things, as I sit here and talk into a machine recorder. It’s just a really forward-thinking concept. I thought it was wonderfully done, and certainly a movie that, from an effects standpoint, changed the way people made movies. It’s one of those movies where people were wowed by the effects, but I think they took a back seat to what a wonderful story it was. It was such a fantastic story.</p><p>I loved&nbsp;The Big Short because it took a great approach to explaining the financial crisis to even someone who knew nothing about it. An all-star cast got together, and the movie was just done fantastically. The moments they broke the fourth wall were just amazing, to explain finance, which is really simple when you strip it down, but finance folks keep it complicated so no one gets it. Man, if society goes through that again, they just didn’t watch that. You can learn something from that movie.</p><p><a class=listed-post-item-title href=#>Related: John Cena Comments On Roman Reigns Claiming ‘His Yard’, Diversity In Ring Gear, The Warm Reaction To His WM33 Proposal</a></p><h2>RVD</h2><p>WWE posted the following video featuring Rob Van Dam’s WWE debut match against Jeff Hardy, which took place 20 years ago today on the May 12th episode of WWE RAW:</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwhJJxb21pXZ%2B8qbqMnJynmV2nsrexwKWqZqCZqHqnrdWoqaKslWK6sMLInqpmr6eaeqSxy56Zq5mkmsBuvtWdqmaclZfCtXnAoJiipqOpequxxZ9koZmimcZuwsidnKg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
