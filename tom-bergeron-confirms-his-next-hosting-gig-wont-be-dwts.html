I mean, you know, Tom Bergeron and Erin. They lead the show, this is one of the top-rated shows in the world,” she told Us exclusively in September 2020. “So [I’m] respecting the stage that they have set and then adding my icing to that. I feel confident about that, but of course, it’s a challenge, but I don’t back away from challenges.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKuopV2XsrOzxKump2WTpLuntdGmqmagmah6r7HXrWShp6Optq%2BzjKCgoGWnpLu1ecGeZJ2vpKh8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
