His untimely demise has touched the hearts of many rail fans across the globe, including those of Elevation Media. One of the last independent creators devoted to capturing the essence of railways was Greg Scholl, who ran Greg Scholl Video Productions.</p><p>Elevation Media’s booths showcased his films, which were a reflection of his talent and dedication and served as an inspiration to many in the industry. The inspiration for the founder of Elevation Media’s love of railway videography came from watching Scholl’s films. Even though Scholl’s VHS tapes were primarily focused on the United States, they did contain beloved Canadian content that drew viewers back to a time before YouTube’s digital ubiquitousness.</p><p>Amidst the Rocky Mountains, he vividly depicted Canadian National (CN) F-units and the iconic blue-yellow livery of VIA Rail. His film #3716 and #2860, which featured steam locomotives on BC Rail excursions in the late 1980s, is one of his most memorable works. The family’s Royal Hudson excursions featured #2860, a shining star, and this rare footage of #3716 in service was even more rare. Scholl’s cherished memory of capturing #3716 on its excursion journeys was the driving force behind Elevation Media.</p><p>Even though I contacted Scholl about purchasing and archiving this rare treasure, he kept it in his vault and never let anyone see it in any format other than VHS. His legacy will live on as long as his commitment to railway history, which he maintained for more than 40 years, does not fade. The work of Greg Scholl was revolutionary in the field of railway videography. His films had a lasting impact on the rail industry and brought joy to rail enthusiasts all over the globe. His legacy will endure in the hearts of railfans worldwide thanks to the lasting impression he left on the community.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiao5x7prDUZ62nZ5ensqh50pyfqKScYryjtdOumKuxXZq5psLAraCopl2isqW1wGakqK2io8BuwMeeZJ2dnZ7ApnnOn2SaZZyatKa6w2agp2Wilratw8CyZK%2BhlJq8brzRqJuum6SevK95w56YraBdqbWmedaoqaWcXaSvqsDSaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
