The only issue is that it tends to get repetitive pretty quickly, especially if you’re layering with the same few pieces every time you go out.</p><p>We don’t want to put fall colors into such a small box. They can take on a whole new life when you add a little extra creativity into a piece’s design. What if we told you there was a way to <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">wear rainbow </a>that was actually appropriate for the season? Well, we don’t even have to tell you. We can simply show you this sweater instead!</p><figure class=wp-caption></figure><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">ZESICA Long Bell Sleeve Rainbow Striped Pullover Sweater</a> starting at just <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">$20</a> at Amazon! Please note, prices are accurate at the date of publication, September 4, 2020, but are subject to change.</strong></p><p>The stripes of <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">this sweater</a> still capture the beauty of fallen leaves with shades of reddish-orange and yellow as standouts, but they add in some other earthy shades to create a fun, multicolor pattern across the torso and part of the sleeves. The long bell sleeves are already lovely, but the dramatically dropped shoulders show off effortless artistry, which is further emphasized by a break in the stripe pattern on the upper arm!</p><p>This loose-knit sweater has a wide neckline that you can let hang off one shoulder, and it’s super soft, not scratchy. It’s quickly becoming a shopper favorite because it’s not too light but not so heavy that you’ll feel like it’s dragging you down. If anything, it’s going to lift you up — your style, your mood, your presence!</p><figure class=wp-caption></figure><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">ZESICA Long Bell Sleeve Rainbow Striped Pullover Sweater</a> starting at just <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">$20</a> at Amazon!
