In the same manner, in 2008, he received an honorary doctorate in commerce from the Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University.</p><h3>Business and career</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/13d2c68d58ff6581.jpg><p class=align-left>With his background, he started his journey in business in New York after serving as an apprenticeship in Chase Manhattan. He was there for two years before moving on to Lizard Feres where he stayed for three years. He came back to South Africa in 1976 to form the Rand Merchant Bank in which he served as a CEO.</p><p class=align-left>It is in this same year that the same man formed a corporation called the Small Business Development Corporation that has been responsible for providing over 600,000 jobs so far. Even though he may not have complete schooling, his passion for finance has been seen through his business time without number. It is not surprising that he has won a number of awards because of the same thing.</p><p class=align-left>Apart from owning and running his own business, he joined the family business where his father, elder Anton Rupert turned a company into a billion-dollar business from just 10 Euros when he started out in his garage. The family business started in 1941 when his dad ran a dry cleaning business before venturing into tobacco a year later. The company developed its own cigarette brands with their first being called the Remrandt, a favourite with most South Africans.</p><p class=align-left>The company later split into 2 forming the Remgro which deals with mining and the Richemont that serves as the Swiss Luxury Goods Group.
