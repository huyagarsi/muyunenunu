There is a lot of work they need to do to get back to where they were; there is still a chance they will get back together. She will deal with the Offset drama eventually, but it’s not on the top of her list. Sometimes she completely avoids it because she doesn’t want to deal with his nonsense. And, time with friends has been a good distraction from it all.”</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/BsJiD27ljLt/</p><p>Rumor has it Cardi will take Offset back after spending a lovely Christmas together.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Those two were able to capitalize on the drama.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeTlr%2BltYybZKygn6zAbrvFn2ShnaJisLa%2B1Z6qZqGeYr2quspmmaKjmaO2br%2FOppxmq5GuerCyxaycratdrLansYyiqmaln6e9qbXNoGSipqSkeqy1zGaimqqUlsCptcCnZKmhk6nCs7GMnq%2BppJGeu7R51qGwZqCVYsSquMtmpaisXaGytXnHnqlmn59if3R9knJvaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
