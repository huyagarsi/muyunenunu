Dianna Russini @DMRussiniThe Rams are pursuing this trade into the top 10 with a specific player in mind and it's not a quarterback, per sources."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

ESPN's <a href=# rel=noopener>Mel Kiper Jr.</a> noted they "at least have some interest" in <a href=#>Bo Nix</a> as Matthew Stafford's successor, but that presumably wouldn't necessitate a move up.</p><p>ESPN's <a href=# rel=noopener>Dan Graziano</a> reported on Wednesday if the Rams were to trade up, "it would be to get one of their top targets on defense."</p><p>Graziano didn't specify who the defensive players at the Rams like. Aaron Donald's retirement would seem to make an interior defensive lineman a position they would have interest in addressing.</p><p>Texas star <a href=#>Byron Murphy II</a> appears to be surging leading up to the start of the draft. Kiper said the Atlanta Falcons could make him or Alabama's Dallas Turner the first defensive player of the board with the eighth overall pick.</p><p>B/R's <a href=#>Matt Holder</a> compared Murphy to Grady Jarrett, so the Falcons' interest makes plenty of sense.</p><p>Other top defensive players who could be of interest to the Rams include cornerbacks <a href=#>Quinyon Mitchell</a>, <a href=#>Terrion Arnold</a> or EDGE rushers Jared Verse and Laiatu Latu.</p><p>This is new territory for the Rams and head coach Sean McVay. He has never had a first-round pick since being hired in January 2017. They have a lot of draft capital with <a href=# rel=noopener>11 total picks</a>, including two in the third round, to make a strong trade offer if they want to move up at least nine spots in the first round.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYW2CcoSMq5imq12nwq670axkpZldoq6stc2gZK2qkZmybq%2FApaOsZZakv27Azqlkamhdpbakt4yan56ZlGK8p3mRaWltZZ6buW6w0ZqdrQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
