Although they casually dated during the second season of <i>The Bachelor </i>spinoff, they left deciding to stay friends.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/jared-haibons-ex-caila-quinn-supports-ashley-i.jpg><p class=p1>The twosome returned to the show for season 3 in 2016, but Jared left Ashley feeling confused and hurt when he exclusively vied for Caila’s affections. In fact, Jared sent Bachelor Nation into a frenzy when he left with Caila, explaining that he couldn’t comfortably date her in Paradise with Ashley’s prying eyes.</p><p class=p1>Ashley didn’t shy away from voicing her frustration with Caila throughout the season. The podcast host claimed that Caila told her she’d stay away from Jared before filming started. “[She] ruined everything and she’s a <a href=#>backstabbing whore of a friend</a>,” Ashley said in an on-camera interview at the time.</p><p class=p1>Despite their tumultuous time in Mexico, Jared and Ashely had unfinished business. “I never felt like it was really over between us after <i>Paradise</i>,” Jared told his now-girlfriend during Tuesday’s episode of <i>The Story of Us</i>. “I’m not gonna lie and say that I was in love with Ashley during <i>BIP</i>. It was a slow build for me.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>The turning point for Jared? Seeing the journalist in her natural element at an event in her hometown of Virginia. “That was such<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp; </span>different experience being with someone in the show and in real life,” he continued. “You were just so down to earth and easy-going, ambitious … sexy. I wanted you that night.”</p><p class=p1>Although the duo dragged out their feelings for a year and a half after season 3, Jared knew he needed to be with Ashley after seeing her find happiness with Canadion <strong>Kevin Wendt</strong> on <i>Bachelor Winter Games</i>. “It was sad,” he explained. “Sometimes I need a kick in the ass. That was a big kick in the ass.”</p><p class=p1>Jared finally admitted his feelings for Ashley during a vacation to St. Lucia with pals <strong>Jade Roper</strong> and <strong>Tanner Tolbert</strong>. Although Ashley continued dating Kevin after Jared’s revelation, <a href=#>she eventually called things off</a> after realizing her heart truly belonged to the Rhode Island native.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGajmaKasW60wKKZqKajYrK5ecKaoKWZXabCqrrNZqmemZOpwG7AzmaYrKCcmsZutYyrnKWZpJ68r7%2FHoqdo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
