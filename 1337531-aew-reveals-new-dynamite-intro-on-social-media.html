But at the start of 2023, we’re going to open the year on Wednesday, January 4 with the first Dynamite in Seattle, marking a full year of Dynamite on TBS. We’ll definitely have a new look, to say the least. I’m excited about it,” Khan said. “I think it’s a nice thing to present to the fans, but frankly, I’ve found more so than ever, the more you talk about these things.</p><p>“When you build them up, you don’t want to create expectations that are impossible. I will say the set will be beautiful though. The look of Rampage will also be different. This will affect the way people view AEW on Wednesdays and Fridays in terms of presentation with the set and the show with the same great action.”</p><p>Khan also spoke about the importance of hiring Mike Mansury as a new Senior Vice President and Co-Executive Producer.</p><p>“Mike just started with us and is a huge acquisition for AEW. He has so much knowledge in TV production,” Tony Khan said. “To have him join us as a co-executive producer and senior production executive is really great for us. It’s so important to have someone with his experience. Right now he is evaluating things in terms of presentation. I’m excited about what he will add to AEW.”</p><p>WrestleZone will have coverage of AEW Dynamite as it airs on Wednesday.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZJsbm5rYWKupsOMq5yvnZGhwG66xLBknbGelrqqwMRmoKesoqR6sLqMrKacoZGheq6xw6KY</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
