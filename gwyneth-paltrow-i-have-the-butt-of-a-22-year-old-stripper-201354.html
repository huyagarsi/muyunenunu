At Thursday’s big event — also attended by <a href=#><strong>Kim Kardashian</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Stacy Keibler</strong></a> — the Goop founder wowed on the red carpet with a youthful, bright magenta <a href=#><strong>Victoria Beckham</strong></a> dress with a black zip down the back that showed off her shapely legs and figure. The 40-year-old mother of two paired her dress with a pair of black-and-neon orange Michael Kors heels.</p><p>Paltrow added that she always pushes herself to do the workouts every day — no matter what.</p><p>“I just sob and then kick and scream and then I just force myself to do it,” she said. “I just got obsessed. When you see results like that, I started following everything she said and she completely transformed my body and I’m so grateful.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZJunlK58r7HWrGagr6mjsrW0jKmYpayipMRutYyhmK%2BdXam1pnnBrqutZZ%2BbeqJ5kWtksp2Rp3qwuMNmqq2qmaW9pr6Ma2dqa2VpfA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
