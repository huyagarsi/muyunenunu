He captioned it, "Here we go!!! Babies are coming now!"&nbsp;</p><p>The Girls Gone Wild creator, 41, and his longtime love, 26, first announced they were expecting back in April. "We both wanted girls and we wanted them to be healthy and free of genetic diseases so we chose to do IVF," Wilson told<strong> Us Weekly</strong> at the time. "I found out [I was pregnant] shortly after a blood test confirmed the results and called Joe immediately. We were both screaming so loud with excitement from each end of the phone!"&nbsp;</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Francis added at the time that he couldn't wait to be a dad to his daughters. "I believe people will finally understand my love, respect, and admiration for women," he said. "I love girls."</p><p>Three months later, in July, Wilson told <strong>Us</strong> "the girls definitely have Joe's energy," which is apparently boundless. "I can feel them bouncing around in my tummy all the time, especially after I eat!" she shared. "I can't wait to be a mommy."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpKilo2S7psPSaKGonV2bv6K6wqKqZp%2BZp7mnvsiepZ1lkZevpsWMsKClq5%2Bjeqi11Z6qZpqZp8GpedOoZK2vmaPAbn6PamtwaWA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
