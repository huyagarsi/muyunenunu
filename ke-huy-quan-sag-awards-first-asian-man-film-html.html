Each one a thing of beauty. His role in Everything Everywhere All at Once was a tribute to loving and supportive husbands across the multiverse. But now Quan has made history becoming the first Asian man to win an individual film award at the 2023 SAG Awards. “This moment no longer belongs to just me, it also belongs to everyone who has asked for change,” he said in his speech. According to <a href=#>Variety</a>, Quan is the second Asian male actor to win any individual SAG award. Last year, Lee Jung-jae was the first Asian man to win any individual SAG Award for Squid Game.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clem7azeu001p3b6vypmqk8en@published data-word-count=93>“When I stepped away from acting,” Quan continued, “it was because there were so few opportunities.” Quan has been vocal about having to give up on acting for years because there were so few roles for Asian men. Quan had to work behind the scenes for years. “When those opportunities dried up, I spent a long time trying to convince myself that I didn’t like acting anymore,” he said <a href=#>in 2022</a>. “I didn’t want to step away with the feeling that it was because there were no opportunities. I was lying to myself.”</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Ke Huy Quan is a national treasure. <a href=#>#SAGAwards2023</a> <a href=#>#KeHuyQuan</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/Z4tzxsGqaF</a></p>— SAG Awards® (@SAGawards) <a href=#>February 27, 2023</a><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clem6x606000u3b6v3jphg3me@published data-word-count=122>After getting shut out of the <a href=#>BAFTA</a>s, Everything Everywhere All at Once is faring better with the guild awards. Jamie Lee Curtis won the award for Female Actor in a Supporting Role, celebrating her win by planting a big ol’ kiss on Michelle Yeoh and leading a cheer of her name throughout the ballroom. Yeoh herself took home Leading Female Actor, and her dress won best supporting sound effect during her acceptance speech. And the whole gang won Ensemble Cast, shouting out James Hong especially in their ensemble speech. EEAAO won the top prize at the <a href=#>PGAs</a>, and is nominated at the <a href=#>Writers Guild Awards</a>. Quan has also won a Golden Globe and a Critics Choice for his role in the film.</p><h3 class=related-title data-editable=title>Related</h3><ul class=related-links data-editable=relatedItems><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/clelvi7xe00000pbjg2f160i1@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>The SAG Awards Have Unmasked the 2023 Winners</span></a></li><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/cl0l9tin000003wn5vkyi8lqq@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>In Another Life, Ke Huy Quan Was a Star</span></a></li><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/clcy1kx9j00000qdhrr6pll6e@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>Here Are the Winners of the 2023 Critics Choice Awards</span></a></li></ul><span class=ambrose-short-hed>Ke Huy Quan Breaks Barriers at SAG Awards</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t8HLrayrnV6YvK57kWlpbGdgZ3yssYyhrLJloaqur3nSmp5mmaeWv6W%2FjJ%2Bgq6ukYq60tcCnZKaZnmKzqrjMZ5%2BtpZw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
