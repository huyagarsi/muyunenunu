“It’s a show about upperclass prostitutes and I played a 18-year-old,” Hemsworth explained. “I was 18 at the time and I played a 17-year-old pretending to be 18."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Host <a href=#><strong>Jay Leno</strong></a> dug up some good dirt from Hunger Games hunk <a href=#><strong>Liam Hemsworth</strong></a>‘s past to share during his visit on The Tonight Show With Jay Leno on Tuesday, Nov. 5.

The host also questioned the star about being taught sex education in high school by his mother, Leonie Hemsworth.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>“It’s exactly what you think it’s like — really uncomfortable!” Hemsworth said. “You’re talking about chlamydia and STIs and every other sexually transmitted disease you can get. It was interesting until she starts talking about her own personal experiences. That’s when I just headed out the door,” he joked. “‘I’ll see ya later, mom! I’ll see ya at home!'”</p><p>What did he get in her class?</p><p>“I think out of embarrassment she passed me, but I honestly got so uncomfortable I wouldn’t turn up to most of her classes. My mom’s such a nice person that she would allow that kind of thing to happen,” he explained. “I was a naughty kid . . . No child should have to be taught sex education by their mom!”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Though Leno didn’t bring up Hemsworth’s recent split from fiancee <a href=#><strong>Miley Cyrus</strong></a>, the host did ask the actor if he wants to have children in the future — since Hemsworth is an uncle to brother <strong>Luke</strong>‘s three daughters and brother <a href=#><strong>Chris</strong></a>‘ baby girl India.</p><p>“Way in the future,” Hemsworth said. “I love watching my brothers raise their kids and not have to do it for myself and have the responsibility.” The Paranoia star also said he doesn’t like babysitting because he hasn’t “changed a diaper yet, and I’m trying to keep that as long as I can.”</p><p>Watch Hemsworth’s interview with Leno and his old Satisfaction TV clip in the video above.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKOimZ1itaa50rCmq6yYYr2trdisZJploKe8tMDIraytnV2ssqK%2B0mamp6SpYsKvsMSrrp6ZomK2r3nOpZtmq5GptrSywJyroqeeYsG3ecKloKllo52us7HDZpmyZZqWxm64xKemZmpgZoB3fZBo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
