However, it is unknown when the duo tied the knot. The couple has kept their relationship details so private that not many know about their marriage. Still, they’ve probably been married for a long time now.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ecelebritymirror.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Allison-Smith-is-wife-of-Arthur-Smith.jpg><p>In addition, Arthur and his wife have remained silent about how they met and how their relationship developed. Similarly, there is not much information regarding their dating history, including how long they dated before getting married.</p><p>Regardless, the happily married couple must be having a wonderful time together.</p><p><a href=# data-wpel-link=internal></a></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Allison_Is_A_Mother_Of_Three></span>Allison Is A Mother Of Three<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>After tying the knot, Arthur and Allison have been blessed with <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>three kids</a>, <strong>Tanner Smith, Sophie Smith, </strong>and <strong>William Smith.</strong> The couple’s first child, Tanner, was born on March 10, 2015.

He came four and a half weeks ahead of the expected date and was put in NICU for some days.</p><p>The head coach’s children have been kept hidden from the public eye. Still, the kids often attend their dad’s team’s matches to cheer for them. Likewise, who knows, Arthur’s sons and daughter might follow in his footsteps in the coming days.</p><p>Fortunately, the Smith family is content with their lives and are now enjoying their time.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Supportive_Of_Her_Husbands_Career></span>Supportive Of Her Husband’s Career<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Arthur Smith’s wife, Allison Smith, has also been his biggest support system.

With his outstanding coaching abilities, his fame has expanded globally. In addition, his family has also come into the spotlight following his media exposure.</p><p>Allison has also gained recognition because of her husband’s popularity. Still, she is a private person who prefers to lead a low-key profile. In addition, the blonde beauty uses her social networking platforms to cheer for her husband rather than reveal her affairs. As a result, it has gotten more difficult to know about her career interests and other things.</p><p>Regardless, Arthur Smith’s wife must be doing well and leading a pleasant life away from the media limelight. So let’s hope she will feel comfortable enough in public to talk about her personal life in the coming days.</p><p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>For More Updates On&nbsp;</span></strong><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link=internal><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Celebrity Babies</span></strong></a><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>,&nbsp;</span></strong><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link=internal><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Feuds</span></strong></a><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>,&nbsp;</span></strong><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link=internal><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Their Riches</span></strong></a><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>,&nbsp;</span></strong><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link=internal><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Siblings</span></strong></a><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>, And&nbsp;</span></strong><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link=internal><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Entertainment</span></strong></a><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>, Keep In Touch With&nbsp;</span></strong><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link=internal><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>eCelebritymirror.</span></strong></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmidk5q5pq7RoquypZmnv7C%2BjZympmeVo8GmvtOaoKellaPBcK3RrZ%2Buql2ouqrAx2auop6VYq6tuMispqdlo6K2tbSO</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
