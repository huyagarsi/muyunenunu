My sole concern and focus is and will always be my daughter, Brooklyn, my miracle baby. She was made in love and true commitment. I ask for our privacy to be respected moving forward.”</p><p>The following month, Moore told Us that she isn’t legally single “yet” and opened up about parenting with Daly. “I’ve had a husband who is helping me raise our child together and I’m thankful that he was in our lives consistently for a great period of time since Brooklyn was born,” the reality star said.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The toddler, who <a href=#>arrived in November 2018</a>, is already talking, the Game, Get Some author went on to tell Us in October. “<a href=#>[Her first word] was neighborhood, but no one believes me</a>,” she revealed. “I heard it. I swear I heard it. … She doesn’t say neighborhood anymore. It was just a one-time thing when she said it. [She says] baby and mommy a lot.”</p><p>Since becoming a mom, Moore has been “worrying” about Brooklyn “like, every second.” She explained,&nbsp;“Is she gonna fall off the bed and break her neck? Is she going to smother herself in her sleep? Is she gonna eat something and choke? Those kinds of worries.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGaknZ6urm65zqipnmWTmrmmrtGaq56rXZmutrPHrZyrq12XtrPAx52YsmWnnsGpecyaqZxllJa5unnAn6ueql2ova2102g%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
