Before Beau popped the question, they spoke about possibly having a Halloween themed event and she even got engaged in a cemetery!</p><p>On the latest episode of Straight Up With Stassi, the reality star revelaed that she wants multiple outfit changes. She hilariously claimed that her whole wedding budget will go to dresses.</p><p>‘I know I want a lot of dresses. But, like, will it take too much time to change and do outfit changes? Will I start feeling FOMO that I’m not enjoying my wedding and I’m sitting here changing.’</p><p>She also will have a destination wedding. Although she isn’t sure which country, she knows it will be in Europe.</p><p>‘I won’t give the exact country just yet. But I just want it to be in Europe and small. I really am not into entertaining people. I think because I entertain for a living all the time. I just want this to be, like, intimate. I don’t care if somebody’s having that great of a time, like how can you not have a great time in Europe? … Keep it small, I’m not going to make small talk with people. It’s only people we love.’</p><p>Schroeder will be the fourth cast member whose engagement will play out on Vanderpump Rules. Fans got to see Scheana Marie, Katie Maloney and Tom Schwartz, and Jax Taylor and Brittany Cartwright all get engaged and (some) get married.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Hopefully, Stassi will allow her small wedding to air on the show that made her a household name.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGejqa60v8hmqpygoqSypbHRZqapnZ6oera8jJqZqK2kYrWmvoyup5ynnZ67qHnWnpudoZ6cerW7jJucmq1dmLmivspmamlxYm2CcA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
