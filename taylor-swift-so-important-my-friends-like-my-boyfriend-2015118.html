We even have girls in our group who have dated the same people,” she said. (Swift herself has dated pal Hadid’s current boyfriend, <strong>Joe Jonas</strong>). “It’s almost like the sisterhood has such a higher place on the list of priorities for us. It’s so much more important than some guy that it didn’t work out with.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>And as for guys, Swift noted that after a series of public relationships and breakups she decided to steer clear of men for more than a year.&nbsp;</p><p>“What ended up happening was I became happier than I had ever been before,” she admitted. “I swore I would never ever get in another relationship if it meant changing who I was, or taking me out of that mode where my friends are everything to me.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>When asked whether her friends and boyfriend getting along mattered to her, Swift, who has been dating DJ <strong>Calvin Harris</strong> for several months now, quickly replied, “SO IMPORTANT. Oh, it’s so important. In every friendship group, you’ve got one or two girls where you hear people say, ‘Oh, she’s so different around her boyfriend!’ I never wanted to be that girl. So that was a huge goal of mine: never ever become someone else for the sake of a relationship.”</p><p>But her path to queen of her tribe was littered with speed bumps. Though she wouldn’t directly address her feud with <strong>Katy Perry</strong> — the subject of her hit “Bad Blood” — Swift did allude to pals who have previously let her down.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>“I’ve trusted people before in friendships or relationships and have felt betrayed,” she said. “I judge people based on their moral code; I think someone is nothing without a moral code. I don’t care if you’re talented or celebrated or successful or rich or popular, if you have no moral code. If you will betray your friend, if you will talk about them badly behind their back, if you will try to humiliate them or talk down to them, I have no interest in having a person like that in my life.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaKuasZykv26%2F1qKdrWWjpHqquc%2Boqa2Znql6rsWMn6minZ6ZwG64yKScZqWpYq%2BwxcWroJ6mlGJ%2FcX2Uamhx</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
